Welcome! 

I am a second year PhD candidate in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), where I am affiliated with [STICERD](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk), the [Hub for equal representation in the economy](https://www.hubequalrep.org) and the [Economics of Environment and Energy](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/economics-environment-energy/default.asp) (EEE) Programme. 

I have a Bachelors in economics from Yale University.

Before starting the PhD, I worked at the World Bank as research analyst at the [Development Impact Evaluation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) group and [ID4D](https://id4d.worldbank.org).

I am also a Graduate Student Fellow at [CERP](https://www.cerp.org.pk).

I have ongoing work on gender inequality in low income countries, including on female labor force participation, delivery and targeting of female cash transfer programs, and violence against women. I am also interested in environmental issues and energy markets in developing countries.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  We exploit the staggered rollout of biometric identity verification, and exogenous changes to the market structure of payment delivery agents in Pakistan's Benazir Income Support Programme to assess impacts on the delivery of cash to low-income women. We find that biometric verification increases women's control over how to spend the cash. In areas where the new system does not require additional payment agent involvement, beneficiaries also report receiving slightly more cash under the new system. However, we also find an increase in reports of side payments paid involuntarily to access the cash transfer, and a decline in beneficiary satisfaction with the payment system. We explore mechanisms for the effects including mobility constraints faced by female beneficiaries and the market power of payment agents.

### What happens when cash transfers suddenly stop? Quasi-experimental evidence from new BISP eligibility criteria in Pakistan

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  A growing body of evidence shows mostly positive impacts of cash transfers for women on a range of outcomes, especially intimate partner violence. However, there is limited work, empirical or theoretical, on what happens when long running unconditional cash transfers stop. Cash transfers may stop for a given household either because their economic position has improved and they no longer meet the eligibility criterion, or because of cuts to the funding pot resulting in a more stringent eligibility criterion. Since cash transfer programs are costly and may not be expected to provide support permanently, understanding how households cope when cash transfers stop is crucial. In this study, we use a regression discontinuity approach to examine the impact of the discontinuation of cash transfers on households in Pakistan who have been receiving transfers over a ten year period.
