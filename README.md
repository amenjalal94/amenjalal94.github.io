Welcome! 

I am a second year PhD candidate in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), where I am affiliated with the [Hub for equal representation](https://www.hubequalrep.org) (HER) and the [Economics of Environment and Energy](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/economics-environment-energy/default.asp) (EEE) Programme at [STICERD](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk).

I have a Bachelors in economics from Yale University.

Before starting the PhD, I worked at the World Bank as a research analyst at the [Development Impact Evaluation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) group and [ID4D](https://id4d.worldbank.org).

I am also a Graduate Student Fellow at [CERP](https://www.cerp.org.pk), Pakistan.

I have ongoing work on gender inequality in low income countries, including on female labor force participation, delivery and targeting of female cash transfer programs, and violence against women. I am also interested in environmental issues and energy markets in developing countries.

  We exploit the staggered rollout of biometric identity verification, and exogenous changes to the market structure of payment delivery agents in Pakistan's Benazir Income Support Programme to assess impacts on the delivery of cash to low-income women. We find that biometric verification increases women's control over how to spend the cash. In areas where the new system does not require additional payment agent involvement, beneficiaries also report receiving slightly more cash under the new system. However, we also find an increase in reports of side payments paid involuntarily to access the cash transfer, and a decline in beneficiary satisfaction with the payment system. We explore mechanisms for the effects including mobility constraints faced by female beneficiaries and the market power of payment agents.

  A growing body of evidence shows mostly positive impacts of cash transfers for women on a range of outcomes, especially intimate partner violence. However, there is limited work, empirical or theoretical, on what happens when long running unconditional cash transfers stop. Cash transfers may stop for a given household either because their economic position has improved and they no longer meet the eligibility criterion, or because of cuts to the funding pot resulting in a more stringent eligibility criterion. Since cash transfer programs are costly and may not be expected to provide support permanently, understanding how households cope when cash transfers stop is crucial. In this study, we use a regression discontinuity approach to examine the impact of the discontinuation of cash transfers on households in Pakistan who have been receiving transfers over a ten year period.

Only 25% of women with a university degree work in Pakistan. This implies misallocation of talent, with large negative consequences for output (Hsieh et al., 2019). In this paper, we survey male and female students enrolled in a large university in Pakistan. We embed hypothetical job choice vignettes into the survey to capture job preferences, and beliefs about social norms and the labor market. In particular, we elicit respondents’ reservation wages as well as beliefs about market wages against variations in work flexibility along two main dimensions: remote or on-site jobs, full or part-time jobs. By comparing men’s and women’s responses, we estimate how women’s preferences for flexibility affect the gender gap in labor force participation. Using labor market data from Pakistan's biggest job platform, we also compare reservation wages and beliefs about market wages with observed wages to infer biases in beliefs about the labor market. Finally, we elicit men’s and women’s perception of the degree of complementarity between the labor and the marriage market for women. We use insights from this baseline survey to desgin belief correction and job matching interventions for women and their families.

  Several countries are investing large sums of money in nation-wide tree planting programs as part of their climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, there is limited evidence on the impacts of such programs on livelihoods and ecosystems. These programs may harm ecosystems and agriculture, deplete water supplies, displace local communities, and lead to more deforestation in other areas downstream. Conversely, planting the right species of trees at the right place can sequester carbon, regenerate forests and provide ecosystem services like flood prevention. In this project, we use satellite, administrative and household survey data to evaluate the net environmental and economic impacts of Pakistan's Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Programme (BTTAP) with a general equilibrium framework. This framework accounts for the generation of new jobs and industries in ecosystem protection, as well as the displacement of existing economic activities like agriculture.
