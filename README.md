I am a third year PhD student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), where I am affiliated with the [Hub for equal representation](https://www.hubequalrep.org) (HER) and the [Economics of Environment and Energy](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/economics-environment-energy/default.asp) (EEE) Programme at [STICERD](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk).

I have a Bachelors in economics from Yale University.

Before starting the PhD, I worked at the World Bank as a research analyst at the [Development Impact Evaluation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) group and [ID4D](https://id4d.worldbank.org).

I am also a Graduate Student Fellow at [CERP](https://www.cerp.org.pk), Pakistan.

I have ongoing work on gender inequality in low income countries, including on female labor force participation, delivery of female cash transfer programs, and violence against women. I am also interested in environmental issues in developing countries.

  We study whether market competition between public officials can reduce corruption. We exploit exogenous changes to the market structure of payment delivery agents in Pakistan's Benazir Income Support Programme to assess impacts on corruption in the delivery of these cash transfers. We find that a payment reform that led to exclusive reliance on payment delivery agents increased reports of side payments paid involuntarily to access the cash transfer. However, higher market competition between these rent-seeking agents reduced extensive and intensive margin demand for bribes.

  A growing body of evidence shows mostly positive impacts of cash transfers for women on a range of outcomes, especially intimate partner violence. However, there is limited work, empirical or theoretical, on what happens when long running unconditional cash transfers stop. Cash transfers may stop for a given household either because their economic position has improved and they no longer meet the eligibility criterion, or because of cuts to the funding pot resulting in a more stringent eligibility criterion. Since cash transfer programs are costly and may not be expected to provide support permanently, understanding how households cope when cash transfers stop is crucial. In this study, we use a regression discontinuity approach to examine the impact of the discontinuation of cash transfers on households in Pakistan who have been receiving transfers over a ten year period.

Only 25% of women with a university degree work in Pakistan. This implies misallocation of talent, with large negative consequences for output. We survey male and female students enrolled in a large university in Pakistan. We embed hypothetical job choice vignettes into the survey to capture job preferences, and beliefs about social norms and the labor market. In particular, we elicit respondents’ reservation wages as well as beliefs about market wages against variations in work flexibility along two main dimensions: remote or on-site jobs, full or part-time jobs. By comparing men’s and women’s responses, we estimate how women’s preferences for flexibility affect the gender gap in labor force participation. Using labor market data from Pakistan's biggest job platform, we also compare reservation wages and beliefs about market wages with observed wages to infer biases in beliefs about the labor market. Finally, we elicit men’s and women’s perception of the degree of complementarity between the labor and the marriage market for women. We use insights from this baseline survey to desgin belief correction and job matching interventions for women and their families.

###  Barriers to climate adaptation in Pakistan’s devastating floods

Extreme weather events are increasingly common as a result of climate change. Yet little is known about how exceptional climate shocks affect the lives of those most vulnerable to them, or about the barriers they face to moving out of harm's way. In this project, we study the effects of the 2022 flooding in Pakistan, which has affected 33 million households and left one third of the country under water. We track a random sample of 5,000 ultra-poor rural households at high frequency over 3-5 years. We estimate the impact of flooding on welfare outcomes, migration and occupational change by comparing the post-flood outcomes of 3,000 flood-affected households to those of 2,000 flood-unaffected households. Given that flooding was rainfall driven and entirely unanticipated, we consider this comparison to be the causal effect of exposure to floods. We also test for three barriers that may explain limited adaptation to climate change through migration and occupational change: (i) physical distance to migration destinations; (ii) presence of strong village networks; and (iii) ownership of sector- or location-specific immobile assets. Unforeseen floods shock these factors in plausibly random ways, allowing us to unpick the impact of frictions.

### General equilibrium effects of a billion trees: Evidence from Pakistan

  Several countries are investing large sums of money in nation-wide tree planting programs as part of their climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, there is limited evidence on the impacts of such programs on livelihoods and ecosystems. These programs may harm ecosystems and agriculture, deplete water supplies, displace local communities, and lead to more deforestation in other areas downstream. Conversely, planting the right species of trees at the right place can sequester carbon, regenerate forests and provide ecosystem services like flood prevention. In this project, we use satellite, administrative and household survey data to evaluate the net environmental and economic impacts of Pakistan's Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Programme (BTTAP) with a general equilibrium framework. This framework accounts for the generation of new jobs and industries in ecosystem protection, as well as the displacement of existing economic activities like agriculture.
